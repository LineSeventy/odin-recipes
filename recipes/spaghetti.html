        <h1>Spaghetti</h1>

        <p>In some Black households, fried chicken served with spaghetti is not uncommon. In fact the pairing is a crowd favorite at celebrations like cookouts,
             baby showers, and even birthdays. Another common pairing is fried fish and spaghetti (maybe Jollibee will consider expanding their menu!).</p>
        <p>
            Jollibee's slightly sweet spaghetti is nothing to write home about; It resembles the spaghetti you'd get in a school cafeteria. I didn't expect much from fast food spaghetti,
             but it gets the job done. Unfortunately in the U.S. locations, at least for the time being, palabok is not offered as a side.
