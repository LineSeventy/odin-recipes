        <p>Remember the chicken sandwich wars a few years ago between Popeye's and Chick-fil-A? 
            It was a sight for hungry eyes as people acrossthe country flocked (pun intended) 
            to Popeye's to try its new crispy chicken sandwich and compare it to the once-lone wolf in the chicken sandwich category.
             Well there might be a new contender for the best fast food fried chicken, and this contestant hails from the Philippines.</p>
             
        <p>Coming for the fried chicken throne and challenging the Kentucky Fried Chickens, Popeyes, and Bojangles of the world, Jollibee is the biggest fast food
         chain in the Philippines. And, after a recent visit to the chain's brand new Manhattan location, it makes total sense. Let's just say the American 
            chains have some serious competition.

        <ul>
            <li>10 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1 cup (237ml) vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon (28g) butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon (28g) chicken fat</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons (43g) AP flour</li>
            <li>2 cups (473ml) chicken stock</li>
            <li>1-2 tablespoon (29g) Silver Swan soy sauce </li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon (3g) MSG - optional  </li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium size receptacle, mix all the ingredients. Reserve. </li>
            <li>Add your chicken to the marinade, toss to coat, and marinate for 5 minutes at room temperature or in the fridge overnight.</li>
            <li>Frying - Dip your hand into your marinade and flick small dots into your flour. Stir that in and repeat a couple of times. </li>
            <li>Pull your chicken out of the marinade in batches and toss it into the dredge to coat; make sure to dredge under the skin and press it aggressively
                 to adhere a layer on every piece. Repeat with the rest of the chicken. </li>
            <li>Fill a heavy bottom pot halfway, at least 2‚Äù deep, with vegetable oil and heat to 350F. Fry your chicken for 8 - 10 minutes in batches or until the
                 internal temperature, reads 165F. Remove and place on a baking sheet with a wire rack.</li>
